Hello fellow earthlings, my name is Prateek. I haven’t done anything big and remarkable in my life yet, but I’m on my way. Most of the time I am day dreaming…call myself a Cloud Walker…I spend most of my time wandering in my own world or listening to music…and yes I am a music-o-holic. Heavy metal, Hard rock, Punk rock, hip hop, EDM just name it. As a kid I dreamt of becoming someone like IRON MAN not just a superhero but more of a genius inventor. I am Trying to work my way up there, taking my time on my ride. On my way I am learning many cool things. I love to work on projects it teaches so much better than regular schooling. I have many failed ones… but it still was fun making them and I have decided I want most of my life to be like that. And I have a special love for Science, it doesn’t hold back, blowing my mind away. I also like reading novels mostly sci-fi, and venture into new worlds. I also like to learn about great people who have done great things that we often take for granted. I started this blog page in order to record my progress and share my pondering as I fly towards unchartered territories.
