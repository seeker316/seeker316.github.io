Welcome to my blog page…a small portal to my enchanted land. Here I am going to keep all my crazy Ideas and interests.     

And about me I'm a music-o-holic. metal, Hard rock, Punk rock, hip hop, EDM just name it (I have a dope collection of great songs). I spend most of my time wandering in my own world (like a Cloud Walker). As a kid I dreamt of becoming someone like *IRON MAN* not just a superhero but more of a genius inventor. I am trying to work my way up there, taking my time on my ride.

 On my way I am learning many cool things. I love to work on projects it teaches so much better than regular schooling. I have many failed ones… but it still was fun making them and I have decided I want most of my life to be like that. Other than that I love science (it just blows my mind). I also like reading novels mostly sci-fi, and venture into new worlds.

 I started this blog page, to record my progress and share my pondering perspective as I fly towards unchartered territories. Smile, stay happy & stay curious.
