# PRIMUS

Hello everyone...wanted to document a robot I made recently. I had some free time and omni wheels lying around (I'll explain what they are later), so I created a bot. There are two more robots I want to document. It was a team effort, and we are currently working on a third one. This one is a personal side quest called "**PRIMUS**". My motivation to build this bot comes from my interest in swarm robotics. I'm intrigued by the concept of a coordinated swarm of robots working together, much like the powerful force of ants or bees when they swarm, despite their small size. The name "Primus" means the first; it's the first of many to come and follow. Currently, I haven't settled on a specific swarm application. The objective is to create a robot that can be easily modified and replicated for various swarm applications in the future.

So let's start with what is a drivetrain. A robot's drivetrain is a system of components that transfers power from the motors to the wheels or tracks, enabling movement. The most commonly used drive-trains are differential drives and holonomic drives.

The differential drive uses two independently driven wheels to enable forward, backwards, and rotational movements in a robot. By varying the speed and direction of each wheel, the robot can achieve forward, backwards, and rotational movements, providing a simple yet effective means of manoeuvrability.

| Movement Type     | Left Wheel Speed  | Right Wheel Speed | Resulting Movement             |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Forward           | +                 | +                 | Forward                        |
| Backward          | -                 | -                 | Backward                       |
| Rotation          | +                 | -                 | Counter-clockwise Rotation     |
| Rotation          | -                 | +                 | Clockwise Rotation             |
| Turn Left         | -                 | ++                | Left Turn (Pivot)              |
| Turn Right        | ++                | -                 | Right Turn (Pivot)             |

In a differential drive system, the robot cannot move directly sideways; it requires a combination of forward and rotational movements to achieve lateral motion. For instance, for a tank-like robot to move forward in a different direction, it must first rotate in that direction and then proceed to move forward along that path.

The holonomic drive uses wheels or rollers that can move independently in multiple directions, allowing a robot to move in any direction without changing its orientation. It can be further categorized into omni drives and mecanum drives depending on the type of wheel the drive uses. The ones I've used are omni-wheels.

I'm relatively new to design work; the only experience I had with CAD was during my 3rd semester at college, and even then, it was just to give it a try. In my team, I don't typically handle the design aspectâ€”I focus on developing the crappy software for the robot. So, working on Primus was my first real foray into the world of design. This project was simpler, but it required some effort as I found myself stuck often between undo and redo. 

Omni wheels can be used in 2 configurations, 3-wheel configuration (axes of wheels are separated by 120 degrees) and 4-wheel configuration (axes of wheels are separated by 90 degrees). I decided to go with the 3-wheel configuration, why u ask? Because each wheel costs goddamn 500 bucks! For the robot body, I decided to go with a hexagonal shape with each alternating side extended. Initially, I planned to place the wheels along the longer sides. However, a fellow team member pointed out that placing the wheels along the shorter edges would be more stable and would also free up space underneath the robot's belly. This space could be utilized to place some electronics beneath. I designed the robot using Autodesk Fusion 360. The image below shows the two designs; the right one is the initial design, and the left one is the final one.

The body plates were fabricated from acrylic using laser cutting. The motors are fixed to the lower plate with an L-shaped motor clamp, and the upper covering plate is separated by 35 mm hexagonal metal spacers. Additionally, I 3D printed the motor shaft to omni-wheel couplings using SLA. The image below shows the completed hardware assembly.

The electronics part is pretty straightforward. Here's the breakdown:
- The bot is powered by an 11.1V 2200mAh 2C 3S1P Li-Ion Battery.
- The driving motors are 12V 200 rpm motors, controlled by an L298 motor driver.
- The brain of the robot is an ESP32 dev module. The ESP32 is a dual-core microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, ideal for IoT and robotics applications.
- The ESP32 module gets its power by stepping down the voltage to 7 volts. Even though it can handle 12V straight up with its internal voltage regulator, I've used an LM2596 buck converter to bring it down. Heard online that the voltage regulator can get pretty hot otherwise.
- I also slapped on a Neopixel RGB LED strip at the base to make give Primus its exotic look. The Neopixel strip is powered directly from the onboard 5V voltage regulator of the L298 motor driver.

The circuit diagram below illustrates how the power is distributed to all the components:

In this blog, we've walked through the design, electronics, and hardware of Primus. Next up, we'll explore the mechanics of the 3-omniwheel drive and delve into the code for our web server-based remote control. Stay tuned!
